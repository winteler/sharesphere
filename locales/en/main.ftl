origin-goals-title = Origin & Goals
origin-goals-1 =
    I started thinking about ShareSphere around summer 2023 after several social media platforms I used made changes with a negative impacts on their user base.
    I already had quite a low opinion of most social networks, thinking they were pretty terrible for the mental health of many of their users and that their
    ad-based profit model is fundamentally incompatible with a good user experience.
origin-goals-2 =
    This gave me the idea to try building a better platform, one that would non-profit, rely on donations instead of ads and would be focus on transparency.
    Being non-profit and relying on donations is extremely important, as it switches the company's focus from making users mindlessly scroll through content to
    generate more ad-revenue to providing a great user experience that want to contribute to with donations. Furthermore, not relying on ads means there is a much
    greater incentive to deal with bots, as inflating the number of users and generated content becomes less relevant.
origin-goals-3 =
    In such a structure, transparency is key, to show users that their donations are not misused. ShareSphere will always report how much donations it received
    and how this money is used, for instance for operating costs and salaries. ShareSphere is also open source, enabling the community to know how the site
    functions and which information is collected. Finally, ShareSphere aims to have transparent moderation, without shadow bans or unexplained content removal.
origin-goals-4 =
    Another long term goal of ShareSphere is to give more control to the communities, by enabling them to select their moderators, define their rules and
    leverage their help to deal with bots and bad actors. This is a long term idea and its implementation is not yet defined but the basic idea is to have a vote
    based system that gives more weight to strong and regular contributors of each community to avoid communities being hijacked.
origin-goals-5 =
    ShareSphere is still in its beginnings and additional features will come in the future, such as direct messages, better moderation tools, additional filters
    and configuration and many more. I hope you enjoy ShareSphere and will help us grow into the best possible platform.
